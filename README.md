# Lab-09

## WHAT WE'RE DOING

Time to try out some drills with objects.

---

## SOME DIFFERENCES FROM BEFORE

Since I want you to start practicing writing classes from scratch, you'll need to read the docs in the starting code to figure out what methods are needed.

We'll walk through one together.

## HEADS-UP ABOUT TWO DRILLS

Two of the drills - **combination lock** and **mini gauge** - are using something that we won't cover until tomorrow's lecture, so hold off on those until after tomorrow.

## YOUR SKILL DRILLS

The following are due by 9AM on November 20th:

- lab-09 : modified tally counter
- lab-09 : regenerating string
- lab-09 : combination lock
- lab-09 : mini gauge
